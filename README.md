# Usage

## Managing People

- A Person can be added just like any other content item in WordPress. There is a Person custom post type that should show up in the sidebar of the admin area.
- You should add at least one tag to each person. Tags are used in the `[re_person_list]` shortcode to display a list of people by tag.
- Organization hierarchy can be created by setting each Person's parent item.
- If you want an organizational group to be displayed on the org chart (see below), create the group as a Person, entering the name of the group as the name of the Person and leaving all other fields blank. Then, set this as the parent item for all other People in that group.

```
[orgchart tree="hide" graphical="show" search="hide"]

# Customizing for Your Theme

## DOM

You can customize the template used to display each person with the `[re_person_list]` shortcode. To do so, copy the file from this plugin `Views/person-display.php` to a file in your theme named `template-parts/content-person.php` and then modify that file.

## CSS

_Recommended_: You can override any of this plugin's CSS classes on your theme. Note that shortcode CSS is only loaded on pages that use that shortcode.

Or you can modify this plugin's CSS directly. They are located in the `public/css` folder. This is not recommended, however, because your changes will get overwritten if you download a newer version of this plugin.

# Contributing

## Sass

This plugin's CSS is compiled from Sass. The Sass files are in the `public/css/source` folder.

Prerequisites:

- [npm/nodejs](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) (see package.json for version)

Then, from the root of the plugin folder, install all the project dependencies with `npm install`.

This should install the Laravel Mix Webpack task-runner. To compile the Sass, from the root of the plugin folder, run `npm run dev`. If you'd like to have it auto-compile while you're working instead, run `npm run watch`.

## Updating JS libraries

- Install the prerequisites listed under the Sass section.
- Edit the `packages.json` file and change any versions you would like to change.
- Run `npm update` to download the updated versions.
- Run `npm run copy` to copy the JS library files to their proper locations within the plugin.
